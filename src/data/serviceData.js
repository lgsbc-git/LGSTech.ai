        "Data migration is one of the most underestimated—and dangerous—elements of any transformation. Research shows that 38% of migrations exceed budget or timelines due to manual processes, inconsistent data quality, and lack of governance. For organizations moving to Dynamics 365, this can lead to serious delays, costly rework, and eroded stakeholder confidence. Our approach replaces uncertainty with structure, automation, and predictability."
